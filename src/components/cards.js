                            Footprints <br />
              One night a man had a dream. He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the LORD. <br />

            Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. <br />

            For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand; one belonging to him and the other to the LORD. <br />
              When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand.

            He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. <br />

            He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life. <br />
              This really bothered him and he questioned the LORD about it. <br />

            "LORD, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life, there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me." <br />
              The LORD replied, "My precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you." <br />

          <span>
                        23rd  PSALM
        The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. <br />
        He maketh me lie down in green pastures; <br />
        He leadeth me beside the still waters. <br />
        He restoreth my soul; He leadeth me inthe paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
        Yea,  though I walk  through  the valley of  the  shadow of  death I  will fear no evil for  thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. <br />

        Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou annointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.                                                                                                                                     <br />
        Surely goodness and mercy shall  follow me all the days of my life; and I will  dwell in the house of the  Lord <br />

                "Yo soy la Resurreccion y la Vida; el que cree en <br />
                Mi aunque este muerto vivira y todo aquel que <br />
                vive y cree en Mi no morira eternamente." <br />

          <h5>Selection 9</h5>
          <span>
            I'M FREE <br />
            Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free. <br />
            I'm following the path God laid for me. <br />
            I took His hand when I heard Him call, <br />
            turned my back and left it all. <br />

            <br />

            I could not stay another day. <br />
            To laugh, to love, to work or play. <br />
            Tasks left undone must stay that  way. <br />
            I've found that peace at close of day. <br />

            <br />

            If my parting has left a void, , <br />
            Then fill it with remembered joy. <br />
            A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss. <br />
            Ah, yes, these things too, I will miss. <br />

            <br />

            Be not burdened with time of sorrow, <br />
            I wish you the sunshine of tomorrow. <br />
            My life's been full, I savored much. <br />
            Good friends, good times, a loved ones' touch. <br />

            <br />

            Perhaps my time seemed all too brief, <br />
            Don't lengthen it now with undue grief. <br />
            Lift up your heart and share with me. <br />
                God wanted me now; He set me free. <br />

          </span>


          <h5>Selection 10</h5>

          <span>
                MISS ME - BUT LET ME GO <br />
                When I come to the end of the road <br />
                and the sun has set for me,
                I want no rites in a gloom filled room <br />
                Why cry for a soul  set free? <br />

                Miss me a little, but not for long <br />
                And not with your head bowed low. <br />
                Remember the love that we once shared. <br />
                Miss me - but let  me go. <br />

                For this is a journey <br />
                That we all must take <br />
                And each must go alone. <br />
                It's all a part of the master's plan. <br />
                A step on the road to home, <br />

                When you are lonely and sick of heart, <br />
                Go to the friends we know <br />
                And bury your sorrows <br />
                In doing good deeds. <br />
                Miss me - but let me go. <br />
